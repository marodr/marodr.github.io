This is my second post on my "website"!

I live in northeast Queens and I have heard about people in the area being opposed to governor Hochul's plan to increase housing half a mile away from LIRR train stops. So I downloaded some data and tried to see where housing could potentially be built in northeast Queens.

1. I first downloaded the data for the LIRR stops and selected stops in what I considered to be northeast Queens
2. Then I created a half mile buffer around these LIRR stops
3. Next, I clipped the zoning data so that I could see the zoning areas now in these half mile buffers
4. I also added data for historic districts and coastal zone boundaries, since any street that is covered under these 2 different districts might have difficulty to build townhouses/residential buildings.

Once I layered my data on my map, I noticed a couple of things.

First, for the Douglaston/Little Neck neighborhoods, most of it is zoned for residential use, specifically for single-family detached homes. When I overlay the historic districts and the coastal zone boundaries, I see that mostr of Douglaston/Little Neck is covered by these 2 zones, so those streets might have some difficulty in building more residential properties. But I do see that other areas like the streets closer to Northern Boulevard, it might be easier to build mhigher density housing. Northern Boulevard might be a good place to build more housing since that is a commercial area and it has bus routes like the Q12 that goes to Flushing Main Street.
