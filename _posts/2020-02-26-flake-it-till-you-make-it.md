*Write summary of findings
I had the privilege to attend TRB 2022 conference in Washington DC in January and I learned so much about equity in transportation. I know that New York City has been focusing in equity in the last couple of years but for a personal project, I wanted to focus in equity in one transit desert of NYC and that is Northeast Queens. Northeast Queens has no subway line but resident have access to bus routes (both local and express) and a rail line, the LIRR. These services have different pricing:

1. local bus fare = $2.75 (oen way)
2. express bus fare = $6.75 (one way)
3. LIRR = Off Peak fare = $7.75 (one way) and Peak fare = $10.75 (one way)

For this project right now, I focused on the local bus routes.


*Write next steps

Next steps for this map is to continue updating this local bus data as soon as the MTA releases. I would also like to add census data to this map so that we can see the changes of population of each tract in these bus routes. I would also like to do a similar analysis for the LIRR and the express bus in Northeast Queens .
