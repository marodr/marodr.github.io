This is my first post on my "website" so I am posting just to try it out. 

I had the privilege to attend TRB 2022 conference in Washington DC in January and I learned so much about equity in transportation. I know that New York City has been focusing in equity in the last couple of years but for a personal project, I wanted to focus on equity in one transit desert of NYC and that is in Northeast Queens. Northeast Queens has no subway line but residents have access to bus routes (both local and express) and a rail line, the LIRR. These services (all provided by the MTA) have different fares to go to Manhattan:

1. local bus fare = $2.75 (one way)
2. express bus fare = $6.75 (one way)
3. LIRR = Off Peak fare = $7.75 (one way) and Peak fare = $10.75 (one way)

For this project right now, I focused on the local bus routes. I took the local bus data from the MTA website and summarized the stop data so that I could get a count of the number of times a bus picked up passengers from a stop. I noticed from the data that on most routes, not all stops had an equal amount of popularity. On the Q12, which runs along Northern Boulevard, east of Bell Boulevard the Q12 is not stopping as often as it is west of Bell Boulevard and then it goes down again around Utopia Parkway. 


Next steps for this map is to add census data to this map so that we can see the changes of population of each tract in these bus routes. I would also like to do a similar analysis for the LIRR and the express bus in Northeast Queens .
